      "When sunlight enters the atmosphere, it encounters these molecules and particles. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are more likely to be scattered by these particles than the longer wavelengths, such as red and orange. This is because the shorter wavelengths have a higher frequency and interact more strongly with the molecules and particles in the atmosphere.\n",
