* Ensure monitoring and alerts enabled on key development components.
* Test the Spinnaker CI/CD deployed environment is working as expected.

## Challenge scenario

You have started a new role as a Cloud Architect for Jooli Inc. You are expected to help design and manage the infrastructure at Jooli. Common tasks revolve around designing environments for the various projects within the Jooli Inc. family but also include provisioning resources for projects.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides.

You have been asked to assist the kraken team complete setting up their product development environment. The previous Cloud Architect working with the kraken team was unfortunately too curious about if krakens were real or not, and has gone missing after venturing out into the open sea last weekend in search of such a beast.

Jooli Inc. management has supreme faith in your abilities, don't let them down! (Seriously, they don't need the dates to slip further).

The kraken team are building a next generation tool and they will host the application on Kubernetes. The project source code is stored in Cloud Source Repositories, with Spinnaker building and deploying any changes into the build Kubernetes environment.
