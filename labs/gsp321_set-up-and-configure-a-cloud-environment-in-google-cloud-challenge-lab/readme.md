You need to complete the following tasks:

* Create a development VPC with three subnets manually
* Create a production VPC with three subnets using a provided Deployment Manager configuration
* Create a bastion that is connected to both VPCs
* Create a development Cloud SQL Instance and connect and prepare the WordPress environment
* Create a Kubernetes cluster in the development VPC for WordPress
* Prepare the Kubernetes cluster for the WordPress environment
* Create a WordPress deployment using the supplied configuration
* Enable monitoring of the cluster via stackdriver
* Provide access for an additional engineer
